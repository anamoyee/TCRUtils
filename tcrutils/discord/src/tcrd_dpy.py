	Parameters
	-----------
	text: :class:`str`
	    The text to remove markdown from.
	ignore_links: :class:`bool`
	    Whether to leave links alone when removing markdown. For example,
	    if a URL in the text contains characters such as ``_`` then it will
	    be left alone. Defaults to ``True``.

	Returns
	--------

	Parameters
	-----------
	text: :class:`str`
	    The text to escape markdown from.
	as_needed: :class:`bool`
	    Whether to escape the markdown characters as needed. This
	    means that it does not escape extraneous characters if it's
	    not necessary, e.g. ``**hello**`` is escaped into ``\*\*hello**``
	    instead of ``\*\*hello\*\*``. Note however that this can open
	    you up to some clever syntax abuse. Defaults to ``False``.
	ignore_links: :class:`bool`
	    Whether to leave links alone when escaping markdown. For example,
	    if a URL in the text contains characters such as ``_`` then it will
	    be left alone. This option is not supported with ``as_needed``.
